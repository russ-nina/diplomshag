    text: "The old Italian term sprezzatura means making difficult things look easy. The painter Edward Burne-Jones makes the difficult look difficult, and depending on your expectations his art seems either laboured or sublime. Among art critics he has sharply divided opinion from the day he started painting. Recently, Waldemar Januszczak flatly called him a “bad artist”, but he has also been praised as one of England’s three greatest painters, by the distinguished art historian John Pope-Hennessy. Which is to say, there is pressure to choose a side. And judging by an exhibition currently on at Tate Britain in London, there is good reason to argue that Burne-Jones’ time has come again.\n" +

        "It is tempting to roll oneself up in the Pomona tapestry (1885; linen embroidered with silk) hanging in the huge Burne-Jones show, because it looks luxuriant and inviting, but security won’t permit it. It also seems enticing to sit at and run your fingers over the Graham piano, which Burne-Jones decorated inside and out. (Like his good friend, the design genius William Morris, he would have felt the impulse to decorate the floor and walls around it as well.)For the price of the ticket, gallery-goers should surely be allowed to feel their way along the sensuous relief panel that Burne-Jones created as part of a complete redesign of the drawing room in Arthur Balfour’s grand London house in 1878. And it would be a thrill to stroke the binding and pages of the deliriously overgrown Kelmscott edition of Chaucer, but someone has thoughtlessly put it under glass.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "There is no half way with Burne-Jones – and his creations aren’t best served by being collected together in a gallery. The opulence dial goes into the red (and smouldering orange).  His work is sensual in both conception and execution, and he was a great believer in context – and, here’s a shocker, in social reform. He is anti-elitist. He has the artisan’s love of surfaces, textures, and materials.Maybe this is why his work has always played so well with the crowds? Because despite his high-flown neo-classical subject matter, he is a popular painter; he somehow welcomes you in. The splashy colours and the fractal level of detailing are an unambiguous enticement to engage. No two flowers and no two folds of drapery are the same, and Burne-Jones and his Pre-Raphaelite cohort took this to heart. They challenge you to put your nose up against the canvas and really open your eyes.\n" +

        "Depending on your bent, Burne-Jones is either one of the last Victorian dinosaurs or one of the first modernists. His paintings have an undeniable surrealism; they manipulate Renaissance themes and styles in a self-conscious and ambiguous way, turning them into an archetypal fantasia, a dreamscape. Burne-Jones was admired by the young Picasso. There is a famous photo of Warhol taking to the Graham piano at a 1975 exhibition, which isn’t as unlikely as it might seem. Both Burne-Jones and Warhol were ‘total artists’; they were as likely to spill beyond the frame, and into other media, as stay within it. They were both obsessed with surfaces.It is true that Burne-Jones pushes the Renaissance nymph thing to its limit. His women palely loiter. They are often barely distinguishable; their exquisite robes are more interesting than they are. Never mind the superlative décor around them, which often threatens to overwhelm, if not digest, them. The Golden Stairs (1880), one of his most loved (and hated) paintings, took a number of young society beauties of the day as models. They look rather the same, in a Botticelli way – it could be one person floating down the stairs in stop-motion photography.",
